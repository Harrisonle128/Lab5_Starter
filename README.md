## Checking Understanding
1. Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? 

No, I would not use a unit test for this feature because it involves more complex interactions such as sending data over a network. These are better tested using end-to-end tests.


1. Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not?

Yes, I would use a unit test because checking the length of a message is a simple logic that can be tested knowing what the output and input should be. Unit tests are great under this condition.
